# C_PROGRAM_Find-Duplicate-in-Range-0-and-n-1

You are given an array of n integers. Each number is guaranteed to be in the range [0, n-1], and exactly one number is repeated once. Write a program to find and print the repeated number.

You cannot modify the array and cannot use extra memory (O(1) space).


**Example-1**

**Input:** n = 5 , arr = [0 1 2 3 2]

**Output:** 2

**Example-2**

**Input:** n = 6, arr = [5 4 3 2 1 3]

**Output:** 3
 
**Example-3**

**Input:** n = 4, arr = [1 0 2 0]

**Output:** 0
